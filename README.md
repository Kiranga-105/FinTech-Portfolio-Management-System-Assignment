# Contacts Dashboard (Skeleton)

This is a minimal **skeleton** of the Rails app you requested.
It contains models, controllers, basic views and seeds to help you start quickly.

## What is included
- Models: Organization, Contact, Portfolio, EmailTemplate
- Controllers: ContactsController, EmailTemplatesController
- Views: Minimal ERB views for index / show / form stubs
- db/seeds.rb with sample data
- config/routes.rb with routes for contacts & email_templates
- Gemfile

## How to use
1. Install Ruby & Rails locally.
2. From the project root:
   ```
   bundle install
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   rails db:seed
   rails server
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:3000 and navigate to /contacts and /email_templates

Note: This is a skeleton for development. You'll still need to run `rails new` if you want an app created by Rails with config files generated by the framework.
